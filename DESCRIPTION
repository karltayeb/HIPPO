Description: For scRNA-seq data, it selects features and clusters the cells simultaneously for single-cell UMI data. It has a novel feature selection method using the zero inflation instead of gene variance, and computationally faster than other existing methods since it only relies on PCA+Kmeans rather than graph-clustering or consensus clustering.
