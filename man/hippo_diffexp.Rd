  k = NA,
  plottitle = ""
)

  sce,
  top.n = 15,
  switch_to_hgnc = FALSE,
  ref = NA,
  k = NA,
  plottitle = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment object with hippo}

\item{top.n}{number of markers to return}

\item{switch_to_hgnc}{if the current gene names are ensemble ids, and would
like to switch to hgnc}

\item{ref}{a data frame with columns 'hgnc' and 'ensg' to match each other,
only required when switch_to_hgnc is set to TRUE}

\item{k}{number of rounds of clustering that you'd like to see result.
Default is 1 to K}

\item{plottitle}{title of the resulting plot}

\item{method}{whether to use Poisson likelihood test vs
Gaussian different mean test}
